In this assignment, I will built an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

Using the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json. I was able to make a bar chart that displays the top 10 OTUs found in that individual, a bubble chart that displays each sample, and demographic panel that displays an individual's demographic information such as sex and ethnicity.And finally I deployed an app to a free static page hosting service GitHub pages and have pasted the link above for viewers.
